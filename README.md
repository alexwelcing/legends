# This

Build a modular Rust core with a React frontend that serves as a standalone, environment-aware monitoring and control utility for agent swarms and container runtimes.

Do this:

Implement a Rust backend that orchestrates agents, aggregates telemetry, manages concurrency, and exposes real-time streams to the UI.

Add a Rust-based inference gateway that securely proxies and monitors usage of multiple AI providers and supports hot-swapping.

Create a React interface with an RTS-style, isometric, Mega Man Legends–inspired visual system for monitoring agents and containers.

Support multiple customizable terminal views, themes, and layouts from a single utility.

Enable bidirectional interaction: the tool both monitors inference and actively uses it.

Ensure the system runs locally and in GitHub Codespaces, with automatic environment detection.

Use WebSockets or gRPC for low-latency, real-time data updates.

Persist user configurations such as layouts, styles, and filters for reuse.

Enforce strong security: server-side secrets only, authenticated connections, sandboxed runtimes, and sanitized inputs.

Deliver a clear architecture and documented design decisions committed to the GitHub repository.

Goal:
Provide a lightweight but powerful satellite control station for swarm management that avoids launching the full main hub while remaining extensible, performant, and visually expressive.
